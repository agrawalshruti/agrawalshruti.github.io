           <h2 id="problem">Defining the problem</h2> 
           <p>Asthma affects a total of 25 million adults and children and is responsible for 14.2 million physician visits and 1.8 million ER visits each year, just in the United States. Growth in global air pollution means that these numbers will increase over time, especially in young children. Costs to treat and manage asthma are also correspondingly rising.

          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>Google.org has paired with Designlab to design a mobile companion app to make asthma easier and cheaper to manage. AMMA’s wearable technology, which works together with its mobile app, helps by measuring its wearer’s breathing patterns, blood pressure, steps and sleep pattern among other vital statistics. The AMMA band can even signal nearby hospitals and doctors when it detects symptoms requiring emergency attention. The AMMA mobile app, in turn, uses these statistics and alerts to build individualized asthma care plans for its user and prevent future asthmatic attacks.</p>

          <h2>Central questions</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>I began designing for AMMA’s mobile companion app by asking <span>a few key questions</span> &#8212;</li>
            <br />
            <li>Who are AMMA’s primary users?</li>
            <li>What are they trying to accomplish with the app and what are their expectations?</li>
            <li>What are the most important functions of the app to the user?</li>
            <li>Who are the major competitors in the field and what are they doing effectively/ineffectively to help their users and how?</li>
