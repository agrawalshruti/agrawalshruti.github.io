           <p class="text-part-p">Asthma affects a total of 25 million adults and children and is responsible for 14.2 million physician visits and 1.8 million ER visits each year, just in the United States. Growth in global air pollution means that these numbers will increase over time, especially in young children. Costs to treat and manage asthma are also correspondingly rising.

          <h2 class="text-part-title pink">Overview</h2>
          <p class="text-part-p">Google.org has paired with Designlab to design a mobile companion app to make asthma easier and cheaper to manage. AMMA’s wearable technology, which works together with its mobile app, helps by measuring its wearer’s breathing patterns, blood pressure, steps and sleep pattern among other vital statistics.</p>
          <p class="text-part-p">The AMMA band can even signal nearby hospitals and doctors when it detects symptoms requiring emergency attention. The AMMA mobile app, in turn, uses these statistics and alerts to build individualized asthma care plans for its user and prevent future asthmatic attacks.</p>

        <h2 class="text-part-title pink">Central questions</h2>
        <p class="text-part-p">I began designing for AMMA’s mobile companion app by asking <span class="bold">a few key questions</span> &#8212;</p>
        <p class="text-part-p question">Who are AMMA’s primary users?</p>
        <p class="text-part-p question">What are they trying to accomplish with the app and what are their expectations?</p class="text-part-p">
          <p class="text-part-p question">What are the most important functions of the app to the user?</p>
          <p class="text-part-p">Who are the major competitors in the field and what are they doing effectively/ineffectively to help their users and how?</p>
        </div> 
        <div class="text-part">
          <h2 class="text-part-title pink">Exploring User Types</h2>

          <p class="text-part-p">The first step in answering my questions was researching user stories. User and doctors stories revealed three key points — </p>
          <ol class="text-part-ol">
            <li> asthma affected a diverse demographic and was a complex disease, varying in intensity</li>
            <li> its severity was generally neglected by sufferers, caregivers or both</li>
            <li> experts believed that poor symptomatic control was a bigger issue for asthma management than lack of medical attention in most cases </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="text-part-p">This early stage research revealed that in addition to customized action plans, asthma sufferers might benefit from other sorts of individualized information. To figure out the kind of information that might help them, I wanted to learn how asthma sufferers’ experiences compared in depth using one-on-one personal interviews. </p>
          <p class="text-part-p">First, though, I used provisional personas to craft basic user personalities. </p>

            <p class="text-part-p">Personas gave a decent introduction. They summed up how asthma can be frustrating, but they didn’t really speak to the entire user experience, so I drafted something that was more of a timeline — a user journey map.</p>
            <p class="text-part-p">With the journey map, it became easier to see how the app could be part of a larger user story. The high-level view of how different user-types interacted and their behaviors before and after interacting with the app, led me to ask more insightful questions about user behavior. I had to think within the context of the user environment, age, user pain and gain points.</p>
            <p class="text-part-p">For instance, older users might discover the app through print media or search engines, whereas younger user might find the app through social media tags and physicians through email or professional networking sites.</p>
