           <p class="text-part-p">My great uncle has suffered from asthma for most of his life. Today, three decades after first being diagnosed with asthma, his lungs have atrophied by 15%. Because of asthma he was prevented from doing nearly any physical activity for years and has developed other diseases like adult onset diabetes overtime and chronic fatigue. Corticosteriods help him manage his chronic illness, but they sometimes have side-effects that can’t be reversed. Our family constantly worries he can have an asthma attack at any time and not know what caused it.  
           </p>
           <p class="text-part-p">There are 25 million Americans, including my uncle, affected by asthma today. Asthma is responsible for 14.2 million physician visits and 1.8 million ER visits each year and growth in global air pollution means that these numbers with only increase over time. Costs to treat and manage asthma this chronic asthma are rising.</p>
            <p class="text-part-p">In order to help these asthma sufferers, Google.org has created a groundbreaking wearable technology, which measures its wearer’s breathing patterns, blood pressure, steps and sleeping patterns and other vital statistics to prevent future attacks. The AMMA band even signals nearby hospitals and doctors when it detects symptoms requiring emergency attention.</p>     
         </div>
         <div class="text-part">
          <h2 class="text-part-title pink">Overview</h2>
          <p class="text-part-p">In order to make this treatment a more multipoint solution, Google.org has paired up with DesignLab to create an <span class="bold">Asthma Monitoring and Management Application (AMMA)</span>. AMMA’s mobile companion app organized adaptive medical data and helped facilitate customized action plans, so asthma patients can self-manage their illness and prevent future attacks. As AMMA’s experience designer, my role was to build a user-centric, user-friendly  application that made keeping asthma under control as easy as possible for its users.</p>
          <p class="text-part-p">The AMMA band can even signal nearby hospitals and doctors when it detects symptoms requiring emergency attention. The AMMA mobile app, in turn, uses these statistics and alerts to build individualized asthma care plans for its user and prevent future asthmatic attacks.</p>

        <h2 class="text-part-title pink">Central questions</h2>
        <p class="text-part-p">I began designing for AMMA’s mobile companion app by asking <span class="bold">a few key questions</span> &#8212;</p>
        <p class="text-part-p question">Who were AMMA’s primary users?</p>
        <p class="text-part-p question">What were they trying to accomplish with the app and what were their expectations?</p>
        <p class="text-part-p question">Was there previous research to support these findings?</p>
          <p class="text-part-p question">What were the most important functions of the app to the user?</p>
          <p class="text-part-p">Who were the major competitors in the field and what are they doing effectively/ineffectively to help their users and how?</p>

        <div class="text-part">
          <h2 class="text-part-title pink">Exploring User Types</h2>

          <p class="text-part-p">To answer my questions, I researched user stories and two major asthma studies, which revealed three key points —</p>
          <ul class="text-part-ul pink" id="amma-ut-ul">
            <li><span><span class="parentheses">(</span>one<span class="parentheses">)</span> asthma affected a diverse demographic; it is complex and growing global challenge</span></li>
            <li><span><span class="parentheses">(</span>two<span class="parentheses">)</span> the majority of sufferers supported the development of technologies that would help them self-manage their asthma, including action plans</span></li>
            <li><span><span class="parentheses">(</span>three<span class="parentheses">)</span> 85% of people wanted to share their medical information and communicate with their doctors in full online</span></li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-part-p">This early stage research revealed that the AMMA app had a lot of potential. It showed patient-doctor communication was integral to the app, including mutually agreed upon action plans, — and that individualization of the care was also very important.</p>
          <p class="text-part-p">I used this research to guide me while I constructed provisional personas and thereon conducted one-on-one interviews with potential users.</p>

            <p class="text-part-p">Personas provided an introduction to the kind of problems asthma sufferers might face. They gave a name and face to empathize with, but still lacked a more chronological overview of AMMA’s users; so I drafted something that was more of a timeline — a user journey map.</p>
            <p class="text-part-p">With the user journey map, it became easier to see how the mini stories about different users compared. An example would be how older users could likely discover the app through print media or search engines, while younger users might find the app through social media tags or advertising and physicians through email or professional networking sites.</p>
            <p class="text-part-p">The high-level view of user behaviors before and after app use also led to more insightful questions about user behavior. I had to think about the user environment more deeply.</p>

Because my users expressed a desire to quickly enter and exit the app, I tried to consolidate feature availability to a central dashboard.</p>    
   <p class="text-part-p">From that central dashboard users could view the weather, notifications, adaptive statistics synced with the AMMA band and access their action plan. All these components would cumulatively decide if the user’s asthma was under control or not.</p>

        <p class="text-part-p">In the action plan user flow, I included user mood assessment, symptoms log and medication routine mini user flows. I thought by having the larger user flow organized in this sequence, users would feel encouraged to log their symptoms and take medications to update their overall asthma status.</p>
        <p class="text-part-p">To incentivize users, I introduced a “<span class="bold">peak flow challenge</span>” and also rewarded users with badges if they logged symptoms and and were responsible about taking their medications.</p>
        <p class="text-part-p">In the notifications user flow I included triggers, doctor messages, and asthma tips as three separate tabs on the same screen. I wondered whether a more general notifications screen would be more accessible.</p>

      <p class="text-part-p moodboard-text">This moodboard is very high-tech with an emphasis on numbers, line and simple forms. Transparent gradience adds to the overall hypersleek appearance of the style, as well as bold, angular, sharp and graphic typography.</p>

      <p class="text-part-p moodboard-text">This moodboard has a more innocent presence and expressionist aesthetic. Meant to have a friendly, modern perspective, option 2 uses bright, bold, textured colors and thin, lightweight typography and minimal lines and contours.</p>

    <p class="text-part-p">User testing confirmed that many users found the status update process to be a bit unclear. They felt that the connection between updating your status and action plans was ambiguous. With regards to notifications, users didn’t find the user flow difficult to navigate, but thought different types of notifications could a little more obvious and easier to access from the main dashboard.</p>
    <p class="text-part-p">Most users did appreciate the overall visual design, weather and pollen count notifications, alert microcards and vital statistics readings. Some said that settings sidebar could be better organized to include action plan user flow screens and there were also a few UI issues that could be easily amended. Users were encouraged to use the app more with the badge, but users said the general app design was also an incentive to user the app.</p>

    <li><span> Overall, future changes would likely involve</span></li>
    <li><span>Simplifying the action plan user flow</span></li>
    <li><span>Making user flow screens more findable</span></li>
    <li><span>Creating a more encompassing app notification system</span></li>
    <li><span>Giving users more context for each screen and/or feature </span></li>
    <li><span>Creating a ‘data hub,’ where users can access infographs more easily</span></li>
    <li><span>The option to forward info to the users’ doctor or even chat with him or her would be integrated in more parts of the application</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-part-p">With the journey map, it became easier to see how the app could be part of a larger user story. The high-level view of how different user-types interacted and their behaviors before and after interacting with the app, led me to ask more insightful questions about user behavior. I had to think within the context of the user environment, age, user pain and gain points.</p>
