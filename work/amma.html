           <p>Asthma affects a total of 25 million adults and children and is responsible for 14.2 million physician visits and 1.8 million ER visits each year, just in the United States. Growth in global air pollution means that these numbers will increase over time, especially in young children. Costs to treat and manage asthma are also correspondingly rising.

          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Google.org has paired with Designlab to design a mobile companion app to make asthma easier and cheaper to manage. AMMA’s wearable technology, which works together with its mobile app, helps by measuring its wearer’s breathing patterns, blood pressure, steps and sleep pattern among other vital statistics.</p>
          <p>The AMMA band can even signal nearby hospitals and doctors when it detects symptoms requiring emergency attention. The AMMA mobile app, in turn, uses these statistics and alerts to build individualized asthma care plans for its user and prevent future asthmatic attacks.</p>

        <h2>PART I  - Exploring User Types</h2>
        <p>The first step in answering my questions was researching user stories. User and doctors stories showed asthma affected a diverse demographic and its chronic severity was generally undermined by sufferers, caregivers, or both. The challenging part for asthma patients wasn’t necessarily needing constant attention from the physicians, but rather not being able to detect and control their symptoms early enough. Even those who seldomly experienced acute asthmatic attacks or asthma seasonally only paid attention to their asthma when the situation got pretty bad.</p> 
        <p>To address these behavioral similarities among asthma patients, I wanted to conduct one-on-one interviews with potential users to see how their experiences compared. That way, it would be easier design app features and prioritize them</p>
        <p>Before conducting interviews, though, I first used provisional personas to get a sense of what the users’ goals and personalities might be like. </p>

              <h2>User Journey Mapping</h2>
      <p>While the personas were useful in introducing general goals and user behaviors, they were too abstract. I wanted to explore these user-types a bit further by using a journey map. The journey map gave a high-level view of how different user-types interacted with each other, both primary users - the sufferers and the secondary users the doctors.</p>
        <p>I used user journey mapping to think about why and when asthma suffers realize they need a product like AMMA. Questions like - How do you keep informed about developments in asthma? Can you walk you me through your last attack - become part of understanding the user needs more deeply.</p>
