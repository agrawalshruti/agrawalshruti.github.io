           <h2 class="text-part-title purple">Defining the problem</h2> 
           <p class="text-part-p">40% of food produced in the United States is never eaten. From food production to consumption nearly 20 pounds of food per person per month is wasted and $165 billion is lost annually. Even after it’s brought home by a consumer, 25% of all food ends up in the trash, costing the average household of four thousands of dollars each year. 
           </p>  
           <p class="text-part-p">From reasons including lack of awareness to undervaluing food, the average American consumer discards nearly 10x as much as the average Southeast Asian consumer. This waste call also be contributed to the consumer’s confusion over sell by dates and food spoilage due to suboptimal storage and misjudged food needs. 
           </p>

       <div class="work padding-3pct">
         <div class="text-part">
          <p class="text-part-p">Even on a retail distribution level, restaurants, cafeterias, fast food chains and caterers nearly account for 100 billion pounds of food waste each year. Whether because of lack of redistribution know how or poor internal regulatory practices e.g. discarding instead of discounting older produce, and misunderstanding about sell by datesl, supermarkets waste 43 billion pounds of food and lose $15 billion annually. 
          </p>
          <p class="text-part-p">All this waste comes as a shock when 15-25 million Americans go hungry every day and 1 in every 6 is food insecure. Reducing waste by just 15% could prevent widespread nationwide hunger and part of the larger solution is educating consumers and retailers about food waste best practices. Another part is organizing and aiding food donation.  
          </p> 
          <p class="text-part-p">There are a few hurdles that make donation challenging for service agencies</p>
          <ul class= "text-part-ul purple">
            <li><span> they need to know where to access the food</span></li>

    <p class="text-part-p">I began designing for AMMA’s mobile companion app by asking <span class="bold">a few key questions</span> &#8212;</p>
    <p class="text-part-p question">Who are AMMA’s primary users?</p>
    <p class="text-part-p question">What are they trying to accomplish with the app and what are their expectations?</p class="text-part-p">
      <p class="text-part-p question">What are the most important functions of the app to the user?</p>

    </div> 
    <div class="text-part padding-bottom-3pct">
      <h2 class="text-part-title purple">PART I  - Exploring User Types</h2>

      <p class="text-part-p">The first step in answering my questions was researching user stories. User and doctors stories revealed three key points — </p>
      <ol class="text-part-ol">
        <li> asthma affected a diverse demographic and was a complex disease, varying in intensity</li>
        <li> its severity was generally undermined by sufferers, caregivers or both</li>
        <li> experts believed that poor symptomatic control was a bigger issue for asthma management than lack of medical attention in most cases </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="text-part-p">This early stage research revealed that in addition to customized action plans, asthma sufferers might benefit from other sorts of individualized information. To figure out the kind of information that might help them, I wanted to learn how asthma sufferers’ experiences compared in depth using one-on-one personal interviews. </p>
      <p class="text-part-p">First, though, I used provisional personas to craft basic user personalities. </p>
