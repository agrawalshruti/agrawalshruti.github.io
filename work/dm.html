           <h2 class="text-part-title purple">Understanding the problem</h2> 
           <p class="text-part-p">Every year <span class="bold">40% of food</span> produced in the United States goes uneaten, 1 in 4 calories is never consumed and $165 billion is spent on essentially producing waste. 25% of food bought by consumers is directly trashed. For reasons including lack of awareness, confusion over sell by dates and poor storage conditions, the average American consumer discards nearly 10x as much food as the average Southeast Asian consumer. 
           </p>
           <p class="text-part-p no-bottom-margin">All this food waste comes as a shock when <span class="bold">15-25 million Americans go hungry every day</span> and <span class="bold">1 in every 6 Americans</span> is food insecure. Reducing food waste by just 15% could prevent nationwide hunger, while educating consumers and retailers on ways to effectively redistribute and reuse food can make all the difference.

                 <h2 class="text-part-title purple">Solution</h2> 
          <p class="text-part-p"><span class="bold">Dignity Meals</span> is a start up whose goal is to help solve the food waste crisis and eventually aid world hunger — starting with the city of Chicago. The Dignity Meals engineering team asked for a designer to conduct market research and implement design that would serve their users best. It became my role as a product designer to understand who their users were, what the users needed from the app, and make sure <span class="bold">both business and user goals were met</span>.  
          </p>
          <p class="text-part-p">For them it was most important that the app</p>
          <ul class= "text-part-ul purple">
            <li><span>provide <span class="bold">easy access</span> to donors</span></li>
            <li><span>addressed <span class="bold">donor guidelines</span>, so donations were safe and hygienic</span></li>
            <li><span>appeared <span class="bold">credible</span> and <span class="bold">reliant</span> to its users</span></li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-part-p">
            After conducting interviews and market research, though, I thought designing an app that served multiple user types — <span class="bold">individual donors, donor agencies and farming and agriculture entities</span> could be an effective possibility. Like the Dignity Meals team, my research showed that thinking in terms of <span class="bold">solely</span> individual recipients wouldn’t work.
          </p> 
          <p class="text-part-p no-bottom-margin">I found those in need tended to lack the resources, like a phone, to gain access to donations. At the same time, donors with larger donations didn’t have the resources to donate individuals and even needed the means to donate to service organizations.</p>

     <div class="work no-top-padding">
      <div class="text-part">
        <h2 class="text-part-title purple no-top-margin">Breakthrough</h2> 
       <p class="text-part-p">My research really came to a turning point after an in-depth <span class="bold">interview</span> with a large donor agency, City Harvest, that only donates to smaller donor agencies. After speaking with City Harvest’s donations coordinator, who previously worked for the Coalition for the Homeless for five years, I knew an app designed to provide access to <span class="bold">wholesale and small scale donations</span> had potential.   
       </p> 
       <p class="text-part-p">One way to approach this problem was designing the app using a <span class="bold">point system</span>, much like in the case of pantries. Smaller agencies and individuals would get a set number of <span class="bold">free points</span> to claim donations, whereas farms and agricultural entities would need to <span class="bold">purchase points</span> for large scale donations. Or another way is simply make all <span class="bold">donations free</span> and have larger service organizations pay the app a service fee. </p> 
       <p class="text-part-p">The app could also have a volunteer feature, where the app could provide an upgraded feature, so larger donors and recipients can organize donations and discounted sales inside the app. Whereas the standard version of the app would allow recipients to pick up at a local Dignity Meals pickup location. </p>
       <p class="text-part-p">Though these ideas were ambitious, I wanted the app to solve as many of its users concerns as possible, so they could seamlessly donate and rescue food.</p>

    <h2 class="text-part-title purple">Central questions</h2>
    <p class="text-part-p">My first step in designing for the user involved visualizing what different user types needed to accomplish from the app. I started by asking &#8212;</p>
    <p class="text-part-p question">What kind of <span class="bold">background</span> would a donor have? a recipient? a volunteer agency?</p>
    <p class="text-part-p question">What <span class="bold">challenges</span> keep them from rescuing food?</p>
    <p class="text-part-p question">How could users be <span class="bold">educated</span> within the app about food donation?</p>
    <p class="text-part-p question">What kind of <span class="bold">expectations</span> would the user have of an app like Dignity Meals?</p>
    <p class="text-part-p question">How could these expectations be translated into <span class="bold">product requirements</span>?</p>
    <p class="text-part-p">How do the <span class="bold">user types interact</span> inside the app?</p>
    </div> 
    <div class="text-part padding-bottom-3pct">
      <h2 class="text-part-title purple">Exploring User Types</h2>

      <p class="text-part-p">To answer these concerns I crafted three provisional personas   —  Mike, Becky &amp; Melina. </p>
      <p class="text-part-p">I was interested in getting to know how an app like Dignity Meals could fit into their daily activities, so I included their day-to-day routine, alongside their larger worries and frustrations.</p>
      <p class="text-part-p">Through personas, it became easier see how all user types could live in same app. I started to think of Dignity Meals like a center of exchange.</p>
      <p class="text-part-p">Someone like Mike could post leftovers from his restaurant that day or tons of overstock due to a misorder for a discounted rate. Whereas Melinda needed to feed the women of her shelter and had funding to purchase Mike’s discounted surplus pasta. Becky, on the other hand, might benefit from Mike’s leftover lasagna from that day — cooked and untouched.</p>
      <p class="text-part-p">These personas were, of course, speculative and needed to be further qualified via interviews and surveys with real-life user interviews. But, as a stepping stone, they were pretty useful.</p>

    <div class="text-part">
     <h2 class="text-part-title purple">User Flow Mapping</h2> 
     <p class="text-part-p">I paired Mike, Becky, and Melinda, each with one corresponding user flow. Though there are many actions other than these in the app. I chose one main user flow for each user type. Inspired by a few successful donation apps Copia, Food Cowboy, Zero Percent and TangoTab  as well as general consignment and resale marketplaces, eBay, Poshmark, Mercari and Depop, I designed an app with a layout that involved creating a listing/post. 
     </p> 
    <ul class="text-part-ul purple">
      <li><span>Mike, as a donor, needed to create listings</span></li>
      <li><span>Both Becky and Melinda would need to be able to claim donation listings</span></li>
      <li><span>Melinda, as a service organization leader to many shelters, could opt for an app upgrade feature that provided volunteers with a delivery schedule, organizes donations and  routes the user to donation sites and shelters</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-part-p">User flow mapping effectively segued to user interviews. User flows made it easier to understand the kind of questions I need to ask my interviewees.</p>

        <p class="text-part-p">I used the wireframes to build a <span class="bold">gray scale prototype</span> and tested it on my first two testers. I told them to complete three actions —  <span class="bold">add a donation, claim a donation and find where these bookmarked items were kept</span> after bookmarking them. </p>
        <p class="text-part-p">Just by observing their behavior, I gleaned that there was clear user conflict between <span class="bold">the triple dot menu</span> and its relationship to <span class="bold">action button</span>. The two testers couldn’t tell whether they needed to go to the triple dot menu or action button to <span class="bold">add a listing</span>. Since I wasn’t sure if this was a adoptive behavior conflict, I waited to see how my other testers behaved. </p>
        <p class="text-part-p">Similarly, the claiming donation user flow also had one glaring issues. Testers didn’t make the leap between the <span class="bold">more details button</span> to <span class="bold">making a claim</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-part-p">I ultimately ended up testing <span class="bold">8 users</span>. Most users were students who fell in the <span class="bold">donor / recipient</span> category and a few working professionals with <span class="bold">nonprofit / service backgrounds</span>.</p>
    <p class="text-part-p">I used an affinity map to group their <span class="bold">thoughts/actions</span>. Because they tested the <span class="bold">same color prototypes</span>, I only documented 6 of the users in the affinity map.</p>
    <p class="text-part-p">I first wrote down their thoughts / actions on <span class="bold">post-its</span> and <span class="bold">scrap notebooks</span>, then grouped the, attributed titles and digitized them.</p>
    <p class="text-part-p">This whole process was <span class="bold">insightful</span> and <span class="bold">cathartic</span> all at the same time. It was a relief to know how the users felt about the prototype and this crucial information became essential to devising new solutions.</p>

     <h2 class="text-part-title purple">Results</h2>
     <p class="text-part-p">Mainly, I learned that</p>
     <ul class= "text-part-ul purple">
      <li><span>Some users still had a lot of trouble with the action button / triple dot menu i.e. figuring out how to <span class="bold">initiate a donation</span></span></li>
      <li><span>some users had no trouble with it at all</span></li>
      <li><span>All users found the claim process to be <span class="bold">jumpy</span> and needing <span class="bold">more context</span></span></li>
      <li><span>even felt the pickup checklist felt kind of <span class="bold">out of place</span></span></li>
      <li><span>all users appreciated <span class="bold">swiping as a way to browse</span> food categories and wanted to see swiping in other parts of the app</span></li>
      <li><span>They thought the <span class="bold">point system</span> needed more of an explanation and more integrated</span></li>
      <li><span>The font was <span class="bold">too small</span> in some places and the links blended in</span></li>
      <li><span>Both bookmark and bookmark dashboard could be <span class="bold">clearer</span> and <span class="bold">cleaner</span></span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-part-p padding-top-3pct">Because of these user testing results, I made some preliminary design changes, but knew that the larger changes would involve further study. I <span class="bold">updated the UI</span> font sizes, links, and added contrast to ambiguous parts of the screen. Soon after, I sketched out 6 alternate solutions to address user friction during the <span class="bold">add a donation</span> process. Aware of the need for improvement and excited by the prospects I ended up with the <span class="bold">final screens</span> below.</p>
