      <h2 class="text-part-title purple">PART I  - Exploring User Types</h2>

      <p class="text-part-p">The first step in answering my questions was researching user stories. User and doctors stories revealed three key points — </p>
      <ol class="text-part-ol">
        <li> asthma affected a diverse demographic and was a complex disease, varying in intensity</li>
        <li> its severity was generally undermined by sufferers, caregivers or both</li>
        <li> experts believed that poor symptomatic control was a bigger issue for asthma management than lack of medical attention in most cases </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="text-part-p">This early stage research revealed that in addition to customized action plans, asthma sufferers might benefit from other sorts of individualized information. To figure out the kind of information that might help them, I wanted to learn how asthma sufferers’ experiences compared in depth using one-on-one personal interviews. </p>
      <p class="text-part-p">First, though, I used provisional personas to craft basic user personalities. </p>
