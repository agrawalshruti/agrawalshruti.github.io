           <p class="text-part-p"><span class="bold">Goodmarket</span> is a grocery franchise originating in the United States. Their customer satisfaction ratings have remained relatively consistent over the last four years, however their market shares have been decreasing by <span class="bold">8% each year</span>.  
           </p> 
                     <p class="text-part-p">Through research, Goodmarket researchers have determined that this decline is mostly due to the global increase in <span class="bold">online grocery ordering and delivery products</span>. Because it’s quicker, convenient, and provides equally fresh food - customers prefer online shopping to that in store. Shopping online means they can shop from their desks, home or even on the go using the mobile app. </p>  
                     <p class="text-part-p">Good Market plans to release their pilot online grocery ordering program — <span class="bold">Instashop</span> — in New York and San Francisco, iterate based on what they learned and expand their products to other cities around the country.  </p>

          <h2 class="text-part-title green">Goals</h2>
          <p class="text-part-p">Google.org has paired with Designlab to design a mobile companion app to make asthma easier and cheaper to manage. AMMA’s wearable technology, which works together with its mobile app, helps by measuring its wearer’s breathing patterns, blood pressure, steps and sleep pattern among other vital statistics.</p>
          <p class="text-part-p">The AMMA band can even signal nearby hospitals and doctors when it detects symptoms requiring emergency attention. The AMMA mobile app, in turn, uses these statistics and alerts to build individualized asthma care plans for its user and prevent future asthmatic attacks.</p>
